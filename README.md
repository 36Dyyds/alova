## What is alova

alova is a lightweight request strategy library. It provides a complete set of solutions to deal with complex request scenarios. We call it **Request Strategy**. It only requires one line of code to quickly implement various complex request logics. , not only can help you improve development efficiency, but also help you improve the operating efficiency of the App and reduce the pressure on the server.

## Is there any difference?

Unlike other request libraries, alova's goal is to make requests simpler and maintain more efficient data interaction.

We consider both developers and App users. For developers, alova provides them with a simple request API and an out-of-the-box high-performance request strategy module. For application users, they can enjoy Alova's high-performance data interaction brings a smooth experience.

In addition, letâ€™s take a look at the specific features:

- API design similar to axios, allowing users to learn at a lower cost;
- 10+ out-of-the-box high-performance request strategies to make applications smoother;
- alova is lightweight, only 4kb+, which is 30%+ of axios;
- High flexibility, alova's adapter allows alova to be used in any js environment and with any UI framework (the built-in supported UI framework is `vue/react/svelte`), and provides a unified experience and perfect code migrate;
- 3 caching modes and request sharing mechanism to improve request performance and reduce server pressure;
- Highly aggregated organization of API code. The request parameters, cache behavior, response data conversion, etc. of each API will be gathered in the same code block, which has great advantages for managing a large number of APIs;

In [alova's future](https://alova.js.org/tutorial/others/future), further request simplification will be implemented.
